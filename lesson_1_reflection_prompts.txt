How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Since we know the new file contains a bug, the bug should correspond to a difference
	between the two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Since it keeps the track of errors or bugs I made, I can improve myself by noticing those
	bugs
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatic saving guarentees periodic savings, however it may also contain unnecessary versions.
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It tries to snapshot the different versions of the whole project.
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	By using commit IDs diff can be used to view the insertions and deletions made wrt a previous commit
	log can be used to view all commits in order
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Because we can undo by checking out the previous commit
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I want to use Git on my webpage project which will turn into a database project
